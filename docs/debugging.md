# Debugging

## Launch Configurations

VS Code is the debugger for this base C++ project template.  VS Code launch configurations are defined within `launch.json` within the `.vscode` directory.

## Starting a Debug Session

To start a debug session open the `Run and Debug` panel and select the desired launch configuration using the drop-down, and click the green 'Start Debugging' arrow. To debug the `my_app` example application, build by following [these instructions](edit_build.md#building-the-example-app) and launch the `(lldb) Launch` configuration that is included with this template.
